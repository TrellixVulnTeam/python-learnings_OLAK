1.The nonlocal statement makes it clear when data is being assigned
out of a closure into another scope. It’s complementary to the global
statement, which indicates that a variable’s assignment should go
directly into the module scope.
Refer non_local and non_local_2.py

3. The usage of nonlocal is very similar to that of global,
except that the former is used for variables in outer function scopes
and the latter is used for variable in the global scope.

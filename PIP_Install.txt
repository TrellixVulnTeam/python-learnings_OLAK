1. pip install wheel
2. pip wheel --wheel-dir=C:\wheels -r requirements.txt
	a.Creates a wheel dir in the specified dir example: C:\wheels. This is done based on requirements.txt
	b.Look for the output of the command, u will see unable to create wheel for lxml.
	c.Download the lxml based wheel file from :
		http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
	d.Get 'lxml-3.6.0-cp35-cp35m-win32.whl'and put it under the created wheels dir.
	e.Then install wheels		
	
3. pip install --no-index --find-links=C:\wheels -r requirements.txt

	--no-index
			Ignore package index (only looking at --find-links URLs instead).

		-f, --find-links <url>
			If a url or path to an html file, then parse for links to archives. If a local path or file:// url that's a directory, then look for archives in the directory listing.


Download and Installation:
---------------------------

1. Install Python 3.5.1 (32-bit) from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-351/
	Download, "Windows x86 executable installer" exe and then run the same.
	
2. Do a Full Default Install and not  Custom Install.

3. Python gets installed at:
		C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32
		
		<User> - would be the Machine User Name
		
		
FAQs:
-----
1. While trying to install, Python , "Get an Error as below when trying to install Python?"
	
		"The program can't start because api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll is missing"		
		
	Solution:
				To overcome this issue, download and install "For Windows 32-bit Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 (32-bit)", vc_redist.x86.exe
				The above exe can be found in python_installation dir or can be downloaded from "http://download.microsoft.com/download/d/e/c/dec58546-c2f5-40a7-b38e-4df8d60b9764/vc_redist.x86.exe"
				Even if you have windows-64 bit , install 32-bit VC++ Redistributable since Python install is of 32-bit.
				
				
		
Setting the Environment Variables:
---------------------------------

1. Create a new Environment Variable under Systems as PYTHON and give the value of ur install dir : example C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32
2. Create another Environment Variable under Systems as PIP and give the value as below:
		C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\Scripts
		
3. Edit PATH variable under Systems Variable and add the below 2 entries:
         %PYTHON%
		 %PIP%
			
	This would set the PYTHON and PIP in our PATH.
	
	
4. Now open a new command prompt and give
		python:
				PS C:\Users\rvenkataraman> python
										   Python 3.5.1 (v3.5.1:37a07cee5969, Dec  6 2015, 01:38:48) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
										   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
											>>>
											
		pip:
			PS C:\Users\rvenkataraman> pip --version
									   pip 7.1.2 from c:\users\rvenkataraman\appdata\local\programs\python\python35-32\lib\site-packages (python 3.5)
		
The above command confirms that python and pip have been installed successfully and set in PATH.


5. PS C:\> pip freeze
		   You are using pip version 7.1.2, however version 8.1.2 is available.
           You should consider upgrading via the 'python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.
		   
		  
6. Upgrading pip to 8.1.2:
			python -m pip install --upgrade pip
			
		   o/p :  Successfully uninstalled pip-7.1.2
				  Successfully installed pip-8.1.2
7. Check pip version:
				PS C:\> pip --version
				    o/p:
					pip 8.1.2 from c:\users\rvenkataraman\appdata\local\programs\python\python35-32\lib\site-packages (python 3.5)
					
8. Install Wheel module:
						PS C:\> pip install wheel
								o/p:
								Successfully installed wheel-0.29.0
								
			This would place wheel.exe inside 'C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\Scripts'

9.	pip install --no-index --find-links=C:\wheels -r C:\requirements.txt
	
		Download wheels.zip and extract it under C:\ as C:\wheels
		Download requirements.txt and put it under C:\
		
			
		o/p: Installing collected packages: click, colorama, et-xmlfile, Werkzeug, MarkupSafe, Jinja2, itsdangerous, Flask, jdcal, lxml, openpyxl, psutil, py, pymssql, pypiwin32, pytest, requests
			 Successfully installed Flask-0.11.1 Jinja2-2.8 MarkupSafe-0.23 Werkzeug-0.11.10 click-6.6 colorama-0.3.7 et-xmlfile-1.0.1 itsdangerous-0.24 jdcal-1.2 lxml-3.6.0 openpyxl-2.3.5 psutil-4.3.0 py-1.4.31 pymssql-2.1.3 pypiwin32-219 pytest-2.9.2
			requests-2.10.0
			
			
10. In comamnd prompt give:  
		pip freeze
	
		o/p : PS C:\> pip freeze
					click==6.6
					colorama==0.3.7
					et-xmlfile==1.0.1
					Flask==0.11.1
					itsdangerous==0.24
					jdcal==1.2
					Jinja2==2.8
					lxml==3.6.0
					MarkupSafe==0.23
					openpyxl==2.3.5
					psutil==4.3.0
					py==1.4.31
					pymssql==2.1.3
					pypiwin32==219
					pytest==2.9.2
					requests==2.10.0
					Werkzeug==0.11.10
					
11. Make sure the ouptut got from above command is same as the contents in requirements.txt

12. If success, on step-11, then we are fine with the Setup.

					
								

	
2. C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\Scripts:
		we have pip, pip3 ,pip3.5,easy_install,easy_install-3.5,wheel.exe all are available.
		Set this dir in path.
		
3. Then download the wheels.zip and requirements.txt into ur local dir. Extract the zip file and then run
	pip install --no-index --find-links=<path of wheels dir >  -r requirements.txt
	
4. pip freeze and then cross check with requirements.txt

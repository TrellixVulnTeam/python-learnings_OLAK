1. Modern web frameworks use the routing technique to help a user remember application URLs.
It is useful to access the desired page directly without having to navigate from the home page.

example :

@app.route(‘/hello’)
def hello_world():
   return ‘hello world’

As a result, if a user visits http://localhost:5000/hello URL,
the output of the hello_world() function  will be rendered in the browser.


2. The add_url_rule() function of an application object is also available to bind a URL with a function.

app.add_url_rule(‘/’, ‘hello’, hello_world)

# The client programmer gets the objects
# by calling the static methods:
a = Facade.makeA('A');
b = Facade.makeB('B');
c = Facade.makeC('C');

# Fa√ßade is often implemented as singleton abstract factory.
# Of course, you can easily get this effect by creating a class containing static factory methods

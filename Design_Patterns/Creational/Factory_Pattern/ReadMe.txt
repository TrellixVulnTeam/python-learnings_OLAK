A Parent Animal class which has two child classes, Dog and Duck.

Then we create a Factory class called as AnimalFactory,based on Parent class
and make it return one of the child class object based on parameter passed.

So its a Creation Design Pattern where in creation of individual objects is done inside
a Factory.
